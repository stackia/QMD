#### Headers

Setext-style:

This is H1
==========

This is H2
----------

atx-style:

# This is H1
## This is H2
### This is H3
#### This is H4
##### This is H5
###### This is H6


### Extra Syntax

#### Footnotes

Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things: a marker in the text that will become a superscript number; a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes at the end of the document. A footnote looks like this:

That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.


#### Strikethrough

Wrap with 2 tilde characters:

~~Strikethrough~~


#### Fenced Code Blocks

Start with a line containing 3 or more backticks, and ends with the first line with the same number of backticks:

```
Fenced code blocks are like Stardard Markdown’s regular code
blocks, except that they’re not indented and instead rely on
a start and end fence lines to delimit the code block.
```

#### Tables

A simple table looks like this:

First Header | Second Header | Third Header
------------ | ------------- | ------------
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell

Specify alignement for each column by adding colons to separator lines:

First Header | Second Header | Third Header
:----------- | :-----------: | -----------:
Left         | Center        | Right
Left         | Center        | Right
